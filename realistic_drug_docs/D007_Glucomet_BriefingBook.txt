[PAGE 1/10] 1. Executive Summary & Key Messages
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Indication: Metabolic-D
Modality: small molecule
Formulation/Route: tablet / oral
Planned regimen (synthetic): 150 mg BID

Key messages:
- Glucomet is being developed for Metabolic-D.
- Primary endpoint: Change from baseline in Symptom Score at Week 12.
- Primary result: LS mean difference -1.37 (Drug − Placebo), p=0.019.

[PAGE 2/10] 2. Background & Unmet Need
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Metabolic-D is associated with persistent symptoms and variable response to standard therapy.
This synthetic briefing book is structured to support retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) practice.

Document governance (synthetic):
- Document version: v2.9
- Program identifier: AMGN-D007-201
- Intended use: internal training / prototype only



[PAGE 3/10] 3. Mechanism of Action
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposed mechanism: bispecific immune modulator.
MOA summary: Engages two targets to rebalance immune signaling.

Biology notes (synthetic):
- Target pathway is assumed disease-relevant for training purposes.
- Biomarker shifts are described as supportive evidence in later pages.



[PAGE 4/10] 4. Study Design
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trial: AMGN-D007-201 (Phase 2), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled (synthetic).
Population: Adults with moderate-to-severe Metabolic-D with inadequate response to standard therapy.

Arms:
- Arm: Glucomet 150 mg BID, n=168
- Arm: Placebo, n=139

Key inclusion criteria:
- Confirmed diagnosis per protocol definition
- Baseline disease activity above threshold
- Stable background therapy for ≥4 weeks

Key exclusion criteria:
- Severe uncontrolled comorbidity (per protocol)
- Recent major surgery within 12 weeks
- Known hypersensitivity to components


[PAGE 5/10] 5. Endpoints & Analysis Overview
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Primary endpoint: Change from baseline in Symptom Score at Week 12
Secondary endpoint: Durable response at Week 24

Analysis notes (synthetic):
- Primary analysis uses an intention-to-treat estimand.
- Missing data handled via multiple imputation (illustrative).
- Multiplicity control via hierarchical testing (illustrative).



[PAGE 6/10] 6. Efficacy Results
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Primary outcome:
- Result: LS mean difference -1.37 (Drug − Placebo)
- 95% CI: [-1.77, -0.97]
- p-value: 0.019

Secondary outcome:
- Interpretation: Did not meet prespecified significance threshold

Discontinuations:
- Overall discontinuation rate (synthetic): 10.4%



[PAGE 7/10] 7. Safety Summary (TEAEs)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Safety overview (synthetic):
- Serious AE rate: 5.1%
- Discontinuation due to AE: 2.8%

Common adverse events listed below.


Common TEAEs (synthetic):
- Arthralgia: 12.2%
- Elevated ALT: 11.0%
- Diarrhea: 9.6%
- Headache: 8.2%
- Nausea: 5.4%
- Rash: 4.6%


[PAGE 8/10] 8. Dosing & Administration
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Route: oral
Formulation: tablet
Regimen: 150 mg BID

Administration notes (synthetic):
- Missed dose: take as soon as remembered unless near next scheduled dose.
- Storage: controlled room temperature unless specified otherwise.
- Concomitant therapy: per protocol allowances.



[PAGE 9/10] 9. Contraindications, Warnings & Monitoring
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Contraindications:
- Known hypersensitivity to active substance or excipients.

Warnings/Precautions:
- Monitor for hypersensitivity reactions.
- Assess for infection risk in susceptible patients.
- Consider hepatic monitoring if clinically indicated.

Monitoring recommendations (synthetic):
- Baseline labs per protocol (CBC, CMP)
- Periodic assessment of liver enzymes
- Clinical monitoring for infections
